## Abstract

Images captured in foggy weather conditions often suffer from bad visibility. In this paper, we propose an efficientregularization method to remove hazes from a
single input image. Our method benefits much from an exploration on the inherent boundary constraint on the transmission function.
This constraint, combined with a weighted L1âˆ’norm based contextual regularization, is modeled into an optimization problem to estimate the unknown scene transmission.
A quite efficient algorithm based on variable splitting is also presented to solve the problem. The proposed method requires only a few general assumptions and can 
restore a high-quality haze-free image with faithful colors and fine image details.
Experimental results on a variety of haze images demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.
